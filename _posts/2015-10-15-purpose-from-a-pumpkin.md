Have you ever wondered what a pumpkin feels? What it thinks? About its dreams?Imagine simply living your life for a season, everything else is a distraction. If you aren't baked and salted and packaged, you can rest assured you'll be left for carving, to be lit from inside, or cut into pieces and baked into pie. A life with such short-live purpose seems silly to some but a life with a purpose is better than one lived with none.So look to the pumpkin and embrace each new day as a gift from above and occasion to say, "I'll live for my purpose and strive for the day when all becomes clear and I live without fear. I'll work to get better and do what I can to make those around me the best that I can. For living for others is why I was made and if I forget that I might as well have stayed...a seed in bag to be chewed up and spit."
